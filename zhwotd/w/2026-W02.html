      <h2>羊 (yáng)</h2>
      <p>羊 (yáng) is an interesting character because it looks like what it means: sheep. It doesn't look <em>a lot</em> like a sheep, but you can imagine the horns at the top of the character are horns. Rather than pretend more knowledge than I have, I'll pass you off to Wikipedia to see an evolution of the character from the time where it did look more like a sheep: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_123">Radical 123: 羊部</a></p>
      <p>I was thinking about this character today because the word of the day today was 洋葱 (yángcōng), onion. (@zhwotd variously on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ZhWOTD/posts/pfbid0Y5LPUe3MBrDUjVexHoncb4GiozjhsHEKLUd8x6vFNrQpwE2qe2hsbCi2dTVGZWiFl">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.com/@zhwotd/post/DTNdW1CjfPi">Threads</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zhwotd.bsky.social/post/3mbtjdy4mck2m">Bluesky</a>, and <a href="https://universeodon.com/@zhwotd/115853923633312398">Mastodon</a>) Some words I learned from reading, some from listening; this one, and 怎么样 (zěnmeyàng), roughly "how about it?", I learned from listening. I didn't think much of the yang, or that it sounded like the 羊 (yáng) for sheep, which we'll talk about when having hot pot. I just noticed yesterday that 洋 (洋葱) and 样 (怎么样) are different characters: one 羊 preceded by 水 (水--> 氵, shuǐ, water), the other by 木 (mù, tree).</p>
      <p>(General warning not to put too much stock into breaking down characters into their smallest constituent elements and trying to extract meaning from them. Sometimes yes, usually no.)</p>
      <p>OK, so how many yangs are there? So, limiting it to just the sheep yangs (forget other characters that sounds like yang, <em>e.g.</em>, 阳 yáng), and the ones that sound like yang (forget characters that incorporate 羊 but don't sound like yang, <em>e.g.</em>, 美 měi where the top half is 羊), here's what I found <a href="https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?cdqchc=羊">searching</a> on the MDBG Chinese dictionary. Another general warning, many characters don't fully function as words on their own in typical usage, but are paired with other characters. I mess this up often enough. Defintions included below anyway, just don't take them too literally. If you search around in the dictionary with wildcards like "*洋*" you'll find words that contain the character 洋.</p>
