      <h2>Now reading: The Dog of the South</h2>
      <p>Now reading: Charles Portis, The Dog of the South. Goodreads: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2977381-kirk-kittell">goodreads.com/user/show/2977381-kirk-kittell</a>. I was looking for a Charles Portis book because (I think) <a href="https://austinkleon.com/">Austin Kleon</a> was talking about him in a newsletter post. (It must be this one from <a href="https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/designed-to-break-your-heart">10 Oct 2025</a>.) I've only read <em>True Grit</em>. Enjoyed it. Enjoyed the movie as well&mdash;the better one, the one with Jeff Bridges. I went off to the library (web site) in search of some Portis, and this one was available. Off we go.</p>
