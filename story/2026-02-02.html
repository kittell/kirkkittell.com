      <h2>30 km in, 30 km out</h2>
      <p>Starting out the year: big plans, big crash. Lots of momentum, loss of momentum. It's the way of the resolutioneer.</p>
      <p>One thing ended up working well enough from calling out some direction on the <a href="2026-01-01.html">the first of the year</a>: running got back on track. 30 km the first full week (2026-W02), then some fall off in the middle, 20 km or so per week, then back to 30 km again last week (2026-W05). I can't believe I even have to concentrate on distances that small these days&mdash;over the course of a full week, no less&nbsp;but here we are. At the very least, I can look at the pickup at the end and take something from that.</p>
      <p>Now: +5 km per week for February. Get back to 50 km per week before summer, then decide where to go from there.</p>
