      <h2>Cerebellum</h2>
      <p>"<a href="https://radiolab.org/podcast/song-of-the-cerebellum">Song of the Cerebellum</a>". <em>Radiolab</em> (2026-01-30).</p>
      <p>This was a really good episode of <em>Radiolab</em>. I recommend listening to it.</p>
      <p>The cerebrum is bigger, flashier, the part of the brain that you actually think is the brain. The cerebellum is more interesting&mdash;to me, at least, although I never considered it before listening to this episode. Most of the work I've done in my career is systems-type work&mdash;how does this connect to that, and what are the effects? That seems to be what's happening in the brain. The cerebrum has the big capabilities, and the cerebellum is the systems orchestrator that helps it all work together, producing the whole effect from the parts.</p>
