      <h2>Now reading: Small Is Beautiful</h2>
      <p>Now reading: <em>Small Is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered</em> by E.F. Schumacher. Activity on Goodreads: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2466711865">goodreads.com/review/show/2466711865</a>. Based on the date I added it to Goodreads, 22 July 2018, I'd say that I found this book in the citations list of <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2391349283">Seeing Like a State</a></em> by James Scott. That's a good one, I recommend it. I must have encountered <em>Small Is Beautiful</em> again recently to have gone and requested it from the library, but I don't remember when or why.</p>
      <p>This is my number two use case for Goodreads: finding out when I added a book to my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2977381-kirk-kittell?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read">to-read list</a>. I've been using the site since 2009 or so, and it's a fascinating journey to go back in and see what I added and when I added it&mdash;like touring past versions of myself.</p>
