      <h2>Places to go in Los Angeles</h2>
        <p>A few suggestions for places to go around Los Angeles, with emphasis on Chinese restaurants around the San Gabriel Valley, but otherwise just some nonsense, as usual. Few things are the best in an objective sense, most things are just places that were a good experience, or where some small part of my heart lives.</p>
      <h3>San Gabriel Valley</h3>
        <p>We'll include Pasadena in here for simplicity. San Gabriel Valley is basically like going to China without the long plane ride, so we went there just about every weekend when we lived in Burbank.</p>
        <ul>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Near the ocean</h3>
        <p>Don't go in the water, it's freezing.</p>
        <ul>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Like, The Valley</h3>
        <p>Half of the lyrics to "Free Fallin'" by Tom Petty came from a map of the San Fernando Valley.</p>
        <ul>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Santa Clarita Valley</h3>
        <p>I more or less lived here for two years.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.thehalfwayhousecafe.com/">The Halfway House Cafe</a>, Canyon Country. Yes! I would trade one of my spleens to go back here. Bonus points! This is where the motorcycle gang scene from <em>Pee-Wee's Big Adventure</em> was filmed.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Downtown... -ish... at least not a beach or a valley</h3>
        <p>Sure why not</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.holboxla.com/">Holbox</a>. Mexican. Yes. Absolutely. Do it. If not, there are other small restaurants in the same building.</li>
          <li><a href="">California Science Center</a>, right across the highway from Holbox. (So, only about a 30 minute drive.) It has an actual Space Shuttle.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.ladym.com/boutiques/details/ca-sawtelle">Lady M Cake Boutique</a>, Beverly Hills. Take home a green tea mille crepes cake. I would.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.barriquevenice.com/">Barrique Venice</a>. Expensive. Italian. Good.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.mastrosrestaurants.com/location/beverly-hills-penthouse/">Mastro's Steakhouse</a>, Beverly Hills. Beyond expensive. Still Italian. Beyond good.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.lacma.org/">Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.getty.edu/">The Getty Museum</a>. Also, out toward Malibu: <a href="https://www.getty.edu/visit/villa/">Getty Villa Museum</a>, because when you have enough money, you don't have to go to Ancient Rome, Ancient Rome comes to you.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Elsewhere</h3>
        <p>We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive...."</p>
