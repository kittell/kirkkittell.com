      <h2>Places to go in Los Angeles</h2>
        <p>A few suggestions for places to go around Los Angeles, with emphasis on Chinese restaurants around the San Gabriel Valley, but otherwise just some nonsense, as usual. Few things are the best in an objective sense, most things are just places that were a good experience, or where some small part of my heart lives.</p>
      <h3>San Gabriel Valley</h3>
        <p>We'll include Pasadena in here for simplicity. San Gabriel Valley is basically like going to China without the long plane ride, so we went there just about every weekend when we lived in Burbank.</p>

      <h3>Near the ocean</h3>
        <p>Don't go in the water, it's freezing.</p>

      <h3>Like, The Valley</h3>

      <h3>Santa Clarita Valley</h3>
        <p>I more or less lived here for two years.</p>
