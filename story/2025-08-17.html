      <h2>Time</h2>
      <p>A few months ago, I bought a guitar, cheap, at an auction. I haven't had a guitar sicne I donated my last one when leaving Burbank ten years ago, and even then I'd only say that I <em>possessed</em> a guitar, not that I was actually <em>playing</em> it, a fundamental action that differentiates an instrument from a decoration. So maybe playing it much goes back another ten years to college, and getting it for the first time goes back another ten years to high school.</p>
      <p>And so on and so on.</p>
      <p>Most bits of living longer and getting older are invisible. Some are irritating. (My right knee pops and cracks when I walk up steps. Every step now.) Some are interesting though. Seeing an old world (a personal old world, at least) from a newer and differently experienced (<em>i.e., older</em>) point of view is one of the things I like.</p>
      <p>There is a subtle guitar part in the background of "Time" by Tom Waits. For the longest time I didn't notice it, and I would have told you that the background was piano if you asked me. I sat down this evening to learn how to play it, or at least grab the chords and play something like it.</p>
      <p>It's fairly simple. D-D-G-A7 verse. D-A7-D, G-Em9-A7, D-Dmaj7-G-Em, D-A7-D chorus. I'm just playing it simple, arpeggios on the verse, none of the jazz-like extras from the album, over and over, getting the feel. Starting the arpeggio from the A on the D chord was too high. Starting from the F# on the E string was too... I don't know, it didn't feel right. Oh well. I just continued to play using A as the low note.</p>
      <p>Then I did something I've never done: tuned down the low E to a D. I'm aware of drop D tuning, but there's just something about not using the standard EADGBE tuning that's... I don't know, it doesn't feel right. Follow the rules. Standard tuning is Standard for a reason.</p>
      <p>It sounded so much better starting from a low D. It felt right. Moreover, it felt like whatever internal block that made switching to a nonstandard tuning seem like a crime or faux pas had crumbled. Of course you can tune a guitar however you like.</p>
      <p>I played piano years before playing the guitar. You don't have to (or it is ill advised to or you simply cannot) tune your piano down a step. The options are all laid out in front of you. It's simple, linear, prepared and provided. Guitars are set up like a matrix. I never really thought about it. The strings and frets are provided, but the values in the matrix can be transformed. I understand it's not true, but it feels like I discovered something. </p>
      <p>It was a similar feeling when I found guitar <em>sheet music</em>. I had no idea such a thing existed, because I never thought about it. To me, a non-thinker, guitar music was encoded as a list of chords or as tablature that tells you what frets on what string. Of course it can be encoded as sheet music like a piano. Obvious in retrospect. But not at all obvious until I could see something old as something new.</p>
