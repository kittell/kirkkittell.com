      <h2>Note hoarding</h2>
      <p>Taking off from <a href="2026-01-08.html#2026-01-09_01">yesterday</a>... Sometimes I wonder&mdash;useless, and worse I suppose, consciously useless&mdash;where to put things I collect, like lines that I pick up from books. Generally I grab them I hoard them in OneNote, a separate note from each book? Why? Compulsion, I'm sure. Some misguided urge to... ? To hold onto a good thought in case I need it later? To recharge some place in my brain that once found inspiration by stumbling onto the same inspiration again later? It's a mystery. There's no profit in it, for sure.</p>
      <p>Another minor reason, probably best classified under the header Justification, is that it would be interesting to share, for example, that quote so that someone else could enjoy it, or go and read the whole book. (The disservice of grabbing quotes is grabbing them without the connecting tissue, as if a sentence from a book could somehow live well without the rest of its body. Anyway, neither here nor there.) I used to be able to do that when I grabbed the quotes into Evernote, where I could share a public link. I don't think OneNote works like that. I'm not going to worry about it. I'll reinstate an old convention here: kirkkittell.com/ref. Useful? Who will ever know. A nice thing about running a straight HTML site is that I have no idea if anyone is ever here. Zero views? None the wiser. Anyway, I'll collect some notes from <em>The Dog of the South</em>, for instance, in <a href="http://www.kirkkittell.com/ref/reading/the-dog-of-the-south.html">kirkkittell.com/ref/reading/the-dog-of-the-south.html</a>, plus an index or navigation of sorts in /ref and /ref/reading. You're welcome.</p>
