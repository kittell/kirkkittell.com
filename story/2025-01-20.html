      <h2>Reading for the Grand Canyon and southern Utah</h2>
      <p class="story-time">19:55</p>
      <p>I'm planning a trip out to the Grand Canyon and southern Utah later this spring. The last time I've been to the Grand Canyon was 2004; the last time to southern Utah was 2015, and also 2004 as part of that Grand Canyon trip. Those were different trips than this one. Back then I had a tent, a sleeping bag, a backpack, and dirtbag-adjacent tendencies. Those Were The Days, etc.</p>
      <p>Now is a slightly different scenario. I offer no judgment about whether it's better or worse. It is. I am. We are.</p>
      <p>But that's not even the point&mdash;to compare this with that, then with now. I've passed over the hill. Of all the discomforts to experience, the break of the Current Self with the Past Self isn't even a main concern anymore.</p>
      <p>The point is: I like to read before and during a trip. Bonus points to read about the deep time native people who lived and walked where I will be briefly living and walking.</p>
      <p>So, for a trip that loops around from Phoenix to Grand Canyon to Bryce Canyon and then exits out of Las Vegas, here are the books I've tracked down so far:</p>
