      <h2>Now reading: Air Guitar</h2>
      <p>Now reading: <em><a href="">Air Guitar</a></em> by Dave Hickey (1997). Some notes, maybe, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7521813445">on Goodreads</a>. I almost certainly found this book via <a href="">https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/">Austin Kleon's newsletter</a>. Otherwise, I've never heard of the book or the author, so it's one of those interesting experience where I can dive in without knowing what it is exactly that I'm diving into.</p>
