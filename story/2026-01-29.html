      <h2>A quick script to pull links from Tumblr</h2>
      <p>I use Tumblr as a linkblog: <a href="https://kittell.tumblr.com">kittell.tumblr.com</a>. Read an article or listen to a radio show (a "Pod Cast"), then throw the link to it up there&mdash;for what reason, I'm not sure. Probably just <a href="2026-01-09.html#2026-01-09_01">note hoarding</a>. What if the though slips away, etc.</p>
      <p>Anyway, they're there, and I'll scroll back through the list and grab a few article/show links for the <a href="newsletter">newsletter</a>. I've always wanted to make something that will go back and manage the links for me, plus the notes that about the article that I keep in Instapaper or OneNote (or Evernote, that's how long I've been thinking about it, I haven't used that service in years, thanks private equity). There's no need for that either, just a fun project to see how things work.</p>
      <p>So here's a quick something that goes to Tumblr, finds links I've posted, and brings them back. It doesn't do anything interesting with them. Step one is just getting them.</p>
