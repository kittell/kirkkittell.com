They must live in a world of reality in comparing the coasts and utility of the shuttle to other methods of entering space. And they must be realistic in making contracts and in estimating the costs and difficulties of each project. Only realistic flight schedules should be proposed&mdash;schedules that have a reasonable chance of being met. If in this way the government would not support NASA, then so be it.

It's come to the point where you almost can't run unless you can cause people to salivate and whip on each other with big sticks. You almost have to be a rock star to get the kind of fever you need to survive in American politics.</blockquote></p><p>And, as Hunter S. Thompson might have said: Indeed.</p><p>There are two themes of the 1972 presidential campaign that Thompson focuses on in FL72: (1) the madness--meaning, the madness of being locked into a campaign and riding all of the highs and lows like a drug addict, a comparison Thompson is eminently qualified to make; and (2) the technical details.</p><p>What I discovered from FL72 is that the technical details of how campaigns are run are more interesting than the emotions a campaign evokes. The opening quote here, about voters whipping on each other with sticks, is why I try to stay away from following politics. Just the idea of the frenzies that people will allow themselves to be whipped into gives me a headache, and I'd rather stay away from that crowd--if only to avoid becoming one of them. So, instead of reading about a comparison of ideologies, I enjoyed getting a flavor of what it's like to be in a campaign: the advance men, the field organizers, the perception compared to the reality of candidates' positions.</p><p>I found most of the details about how the Democratic National Convention works to be incomprehensible. There is a long piece in the middle of the book, a transcript recorded among Thompson and two of George McGovern's staff on the beach in Miami, that describes roll calls and challenges and delegate maneuvering and other things that I couldn't grasp and don't have the heart to read again. On one hand, it was an awful, boring bit of description; on the other hand, I suppose that that's how the process of selecting a presidential candidate works and that was the point of the oppressive drudgery of that section.</p><p>My favorite aspect of FL72 is the angle from which it is written, that is, the complete lack of pretense about his own feelings while covering the campaign. I prefer that Thompson revels in his own bias instead of passing off his writing as, well, fair and balanced.</p><p><blockquote>So much for Objective Journalism. Don't bother to look for it here--not under any byline of mine; or anyone else I can think of. With the possible exception of things like box scores, race results, and stock market tabulations, there is no such thing as Objective Journalism. The phrase itself is a pompous contradiction in terms.</blockquote></p><p>Finally, if you've decided that you want to read some--any--Hunter S. Thompson, don't start with <i>[b:Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|7745|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream|Hunter S. Thompson|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1255576700s/7745.jpg|1309111]</i>. Don't. It will still be there later. Start with this book or <i>[b:The Great Shark Hunt|10878|The Great Shark Hunt  Strange Tales from a Strange Time|Hunter S. Thompson|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1166334568s/10878.jpg|1005676]</i> (which also contains selections from FL72) instead. Either of these will give you an understanding that there is wisdom and keenness mixed in with the madness of Thompson's writing--perhaps even a brilliant mind at work despite, or because of, that madness.</p>",,,1,0

It was interesting, for example, to consider how improbable it is for fossils to form and how few fossils establish the basis of our knowledge of dinosaurs, humans, etc. This was something I had never considered.<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed in this book were the stories of the people who made -- and stole and obscured and prevented and so on -- the discoveries that our fundamental knowledge of the universe is based on. I had never considered that concepts such as the taxonomy of living things, plate tectonics, the structure of atoms, etc., were defined as much by the politics, caprice, and egotism of people as they were by theories and observations. I thought this was all absolutely established. It is not.<br/><br/>One further thing I liked about the book is that [a:Bill Bryson|7|Bill Bryson|http://photo.goodreads.com/authors/1189096502p2/7.jpg] shows some humility in his discussion of the topics. From the very beginning he says, ""I don't know anything."" Then he methodically walks through how he learned about the topics, including many names of people and books where the curious can go to learn more. When the topics become murky or controversial, it is easy to tell when he is taking a stand on one side or when he is guessing to synthesize varying viewpoints.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the book. It was a good reminder that understanding ""why"" is even more important than understanding ""what."" Now I will try to rearm myself with that same curiosity.",,,1,0
