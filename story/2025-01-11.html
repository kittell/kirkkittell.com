      <h2>The supremacy of the air</h2>
      <p class="story-time">22:10</p>
      <p>While processing a lot of World War I aircraft books for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/cedarcreektrailbooks">Cedar Creek Trail Books</a>, I found this epigraph in the front of <em>The Fighters: The Men and Machines of the First Air War</em> by Thomas R. Funderburk (1965):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The Supremacy of the Air"</p>
        <p>"Despite the victory, and even if it is a hard-wrested victory, there is always that sad regret, that human sympathy for the victim, who was, after all, another pilot like oneself..."</p>
        <p>Hermann Becker</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I haven't been able to find the source of the quotation. No doubt it is in German since Becker was a German fighter pilot in World War I. On Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Becker">Hermann Becker</a>.</p>
      <p>Honor in combat and competition.</p>
