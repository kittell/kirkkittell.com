      <h2>Now reading: Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace</h2>
      <p>On Goodreads: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/108288278">https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/108288278</a></p>

      <p>This is my second time through <em>Infinite Jest</em>. The first time, back in 2010, was difficult. This time through&mdash;I'm maybe 35% through now&mdash; is quite a lot easier. The style, the density, the footnotes are all a bit less shocking. This time I can just strap in and go.</p>

      <p>One surprising thing: when I first read it I was living in Massachusetts, but maybe only one year into a three year stint there. I would have thought I was better tuned into the Boston geography and culture while living there in Lowell, but I guess I hadn't marinated in it long enough. </p>

      <p>And also, I think just getting older helps. So much of the book is about uncontrollable habits and addictions, and if you haven't had some or known someone who has had some, and so on, it's really just a matter of time, the experience will find you.</p>
