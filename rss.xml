      <blockquote><p>I felt queasy. I took two of the orange pills. I can't say I was really sick, unless you count narcolepsy and mild xenophobia, but I was a little queasy.</p></blockquote>
      <p>Charles Portis. <em>The Dog of the South</em>. I can't believe (a) this book exists and (b) I've never heard of it before. Granted, I've been reading it for ages (surely the library will want it back soon) and I have read some Charles Portis before&mdash;only <em>True Grit</em>, which is famous enough to not need introduction.</p>
      <p>But: the dialogue. The patter. I can't imagine writing it. I recognize some of it&mdash;at least the way that people talk past and through each other. I'm from the middle of nowhere, not really from the South, but some of the same tendencies are there. We're not the same people, but we're not that far away. All of the ridiculous dialogue... it's alien, but familiar. I've got maybe 50 pages left to go, and I'm not even sure there's a plot, but I'm keenly plugged into the dialogue. Just give me some more Arkansan babbling, however it comes.</p>

      <p>A little feature I've been meaning to include with Chinese Word of the Day for years. Finally using the opportunity of a new year to try it out.</p>

      <p>A few notes after reading: Dave Winer, "<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/12/14/142421.html?title=aReallySimpleSocialWeb">A Really Simple social web</a>", <em>Scripting News</em> (2025-12-14)</p>
      <p>Since I started writing again (occasionally, intermittently, &c.) last year, I've just been doing a straight HTML (+ CSS + JavaScript) website. The impetus for that was fairly simple: I had been paying a lot for web hosting over the years and I stopped doing that entirely. I think the folks at <a hr3ef="https://www.siteground.com">SiteGround</a> did a good job, but spending the money was a hard sell at home.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, I also like the attitude of running a site in plain HTML again&mdash;it's just like the 90s again. And I'm one of those people who yells at clouds about how the web used to be Good&mdash;well, if not Good like the quality of the web sites was good, but at least it was Nice. Maybe it was because everyone wasn't online yet, so the network effect of so many people yelling at each other hadn't been activated yet. I'm sure that's part of it. But also there was friction involved in creating and maintaining a site. If nothing else, some of the effort that could otherwise be spent on yelling had to be spent on doing what is now handled by Someone Else, some social media company or WordPress as a backend or whatever.</p>
      <p>So it's nice&mdash;Nice&mdash;to go back to a low quality site again. I'm not sure it will lead to high quality thoughts, but I'll be too busy opening and closing tags to care.</p>
      <p>Anyway, that wasn't the point. The point was: running a web site out of WordPress meant that I had a ready-to-go RSS feed. The software created it for me based on the post I entered into the backend form which was stored off in a database and some tables somewhere. It felt like something technically advanced&mdash;some kind of magic that I couldn't possibly understand.</p>
      <p>I looked into it. So. It's just an XML file with the text/code from the blog posts. Obviously. I'm not sure what I was expecting.</p>
      <p>So, here it is again: <a href="http://www.kirkkittell.com/rss.xml">kirkkittell.com/rss.xml</a>.</p>
      <p>One day I might automate some of this site&mdash;something that will allow easy changing of all the post templates, for example, or copying over HTML blog post articles into the RSS file. Or maybe not. I don't know. There's <em>something</em> satisfying about doing things the difficult, contrarian way, but maybe that's just my problems talking. In the meanwhile I'm going to copy and paste the text, just as Nature intended.</p>
      <p>Related, I guess: this many years later, it's still irritating that Google killed Google Reader... but I didn't realize it was all the way back in 2013 that it got axed. (David Pierce, "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social">Who killed Google Reader?</a>", <em>The Verge</em> (2023-06-30)). I use Feedly's <a href="https://feedly.com/news-reader">News Reader</a> now, which is probably the closest in spirit to Google Reader, but there will always be a Google Reader sized hole out there.</p>
